# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES (UNAC-FIME-LENGUAGE-DE-PROGRAMACION)
The course aims to establish a solid foundation in Python 3 programming, equipping students with the essential skills needed for their academic and professional careers. By focusing on both theoretical programming language concepts and practical applications, the course will provide a comprehensive understanding of how computers execute code at a low level. Students will gain the ability to write clean, efficient, and well-structured code, understanding the available programming tools and how to apply them effectively. This knowledge will empower them to tackle computational problems, optimizing their code as necessary to ensure efficient hardware utilization.

The course will introduce the fundamental principles of programming language theory, combined with hands-on programming exercises in Python 3. This will not only reinforce theoretical knowledge but also illustrate how these concepts shape modern programming practices. Additionally, students will gain introductory experience with machine-assisted proof through interactive code systems, further enhancing their programming skills. Once the foundational concepts are covered, the course will expand into more advanced topics, including parametric polymorphism, object-oriented programming, type classes, monads, and continuations, providing students with a well-rounded understanding of modern programming paradigms.
